CBCM has a batch process to merge mail that is outside of package manager. How does that work?

Package manager endpoints we can tie into where we can ship a package of data simiar to what we do.

Mail Managment Contract
	- CMP falls under this contract
	- Melissa Fiedler (Core for CMP), Angel Figueroa, and Timothy Wagner are with the centralized mail portal group.
